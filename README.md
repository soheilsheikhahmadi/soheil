# Data-Driven Energy Consumption PredictionData-Driven Energy Consumption PredictionData-Driven Energy Consumption Prediction
This paper presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting energy consumption with the aim of optimizing energy usage in various environments. The dataset used includes features such as temperature, humidity, square footage, time of day, and the operational status of energy systems like HVAC and lighting. The primary objective of this study is to enhance the accuracy of energy consumption predictions by considering environmental and operational parameters. Multiple machine learning models, including MLP regression, XGBoost, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet, are employed for training and evaluation. These models are optimized using grid search to identify the best combination of hyperparameters. Furthermore, a comparison with similar studies reveals that the models used in this research show significant improvements in predictive accuracy compared to previous methods. Dataset used in this study is sourced from Kaggle. This study offers a promising tool for efficient energy management and cost reduction in smart energy systems.
